# Boss Cube Web Control - Version History

## Version 2.28.0 (2026-03-25)

### 🔬 **Discovery Tools, Complete SysEx Coverage & DRY Refactors**

New SysEx discovery dashboard, block reads for fast initialization, corrected parameter values from official address map, and major code deduplication.

### ✨ **What's New**

- **SysEx Discovery Dashboard**: Modal dev tool with live monitoring, block range scanner with diff mode, and tweak panel for probing unknown addresses
- **Block reads for initialization**: `readAllValues` now uses 6 block reads instead of individual requests — much faster startup
- **Cached BLE reconnect**: Automatically reconnects to previously paired Boss Cube without showing device picker
- **Device settings panel**: Noise suppressor, AUX IN ducking, connectivity (loopback, BLE ID, Apply Panel Condition), foot switch assigns, and audio output controls
- **Tuner accidental control**: Flat/Natural/Sharp selection for manual tuner mode; corrected manual key values (C–B + 5A/5A♭)
- **Battery level badge**: Shows battery state from amp hardware feedback
- **USB mixer controls**: Mix Level and Master Out Level now in mixer section
- **Harmony controls**: Voice Assign, Accurate, Key (Auto/Set), Key Setup with proper disabled-when logic
- **Guitar delay level**: Max corrected to 120 (from 100), delay time range to 0–999ms

### 🏗️ **DRY & Architecture Improvements**

- **Effect definitions consolidated**: `EFFECT_SWITCH_MAP`, `normalizeEffectKey`, `refreshEffectButtons` extracted to `effect-definitions.js` — single source of truth replacing duplicates in 3 files
- **Block read definitions shared**: `BossCubeController.BLOCK_READS` used by both controller and discovery dashboard
- **`createLooperControl` merged** into `createButtonGroupControl` (icon+label buttons via `opts.buttons`)
- **`createToggleGroupControl`** extracted for composite params (looper assigns) — shared between app and live performance
- **`LOOPER_BUTTONS`** extracted to `constants.js`
- **Effect buttons generated from param data** — no more hardcoded HTML button lists
- **5 parameter max values corrected** from official Roland `address_map.js`
- **Hidden byte1 params** (reverb pre-delay, delay time) properly filtered from UI

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes**

- Effect toggle busy guard prevents duplicate toggle operations
- Hidden params no longer rendered as sliders in reverb/delay sections
- `looper-timeline.js` added to service worker cache for offline support

## Version 2.27.0 (2025-03-25)

### 🚀 **Architecture Refactor, Versioned Deployment & Bug Fixes**

Major refactoring of the codebase for maintainability, plus versioned deployment infrastructure and several bug fixes.

### ✨ **What's New**

- **In-app version switcher**: Dropdown in the header lets you switch between deployed versions
- **Versioned deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow deploys tagged versions to `gh-pages` under `/v/<tag>/` subdirectories
- **Dark/light mode**: Theme toggle in the header with persistence
- **Preset export/import**: Save and load Live Performance presets as JSON files
- **Settings loaded on startup**: Settings (CC codes etc.) now apply correctly without requiring a manual "Save" click
- **Tab switching no longer closes Live Performance**: Switching browser tabs keeps Live Performance mode open
- **Pedal control persistence**: Selected pedal parameter is remembered when Live Performance is closed and reopened
- **Master/Aux bind fix**: "Bind master out with Aux" now correctly mirrors volume changes in both directions

### 🏗️ **Architecture Improvements**

- **Event bus** (`event-bus.js`): Lightweight pub/sub replacing `window.*` global function assignments
- **Control factory** (`control-factory.js`): Centralized UI control creation (sliders, button groups, looper) with shared drag interaction logic — eliminates duplication between `app.js` and `live-performance.js`
- **CSS modularization**: Extracted Live Performance styles (977 lines) and Tuner styles (198 lines) into separate files; introduced CSS custom properties for theming
- **Shared constants**: Interaction thresholds moved from hardcoded values to `constants.js`
- **Dead code removal**: Removed unused variables, duplicate `window.*` assignments, stale SW cache entries

## Version 2.26.1 (2025-03-25)

### 🔀 **Version Switcher Backport**

Backport of the in-app version switcher to the v2.26.x release line.

- **In-app version switcher**: Dropdown in the header to switch between deployed versions
- **GitHub Actions deploy workflow**: Tagged versions deploy automatically to `gh-pages`

---

## Version 2.26.0 (2025-01-09)

### 🔁 **Looper Volume Control & Amp Type Buttons**

Added virtual looper volume parameter and converted amp type to intuitive button controls.

### ✨ **What's New**

- **Looper Volume slider**: New virtual parameter in mixer section simulates missing Boss Cube looper volume control
- **Smart volume balancing**: Adjusts Master Volume up/down while maintaining Guitar/Mic input audibility (5% minimum levels)
- **Amp Type buttons**: Converted from slider to effect-style buttons (Normal, Bright, Wide, Instrument, Clean, Crunch, Lead, Acoustic Sim, Mic)
- **Full pedal support**: Both controls work with EV-1-WL expression pedal
- **Live Performance integration**: Both controls available in Live Performance mode with button interfaces
- **Sequential GATT updates**: Eliminates Bluetooth conflicts during multi-parameter adjustments

**Use Case**: Control looper playbook volume and quickly switch amp types during live performance.

**How to use**: Find "Looper Volume" slider and "Amp Type" buttons in mixer/guitar sections, or assign to pedal for expression control.

1. **Bluetooth HCI Analysis** - Capturing communication between official Boss Tone Studio app and Boss Cube II
2. **SysEx Protocol Mapping** - Documenting parameter addresses, value ranges, and command formats  
3. **Web Bluetooth Implementation** - Translating protocol knowledge into web-based control interface
4. **Community Validation** - Testing and verification by Boss Cube II users

Based on the [Boss Cube Street II SysEx project](https://github.com/PetrDlouhy/street-cube-II-sysex) documentation.
