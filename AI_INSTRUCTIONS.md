This document is a code of conduct for AI to develop this app.

Main checkpoints:
- Follow semantic versioning with appendix parts for development versions (e.g., 2.22.14-alpha.1, 2.22.14-beta.2, 2.22.14-rc.1). Increment appendix during development after every change so I can see that something changed and the app updates.
- Read README.md, PLANNING.md, TASKS.md documents to understand the app.
- Documentation of Boss Cube Street II SysEx protocol is in the ../street-cube-II-sysex/README.md (relative to this file).
- After every change update HISTORY.md with a summary of changes using the development version format.
- Try to make clean, well-structured code that will be easy to maintain in the future.
- I prefer clean and simple solutions. Don't overcomplicate things, make them rather simpler.
- When there is a bug, debug it first. You can always add debug outputs and ask me to send them results.
